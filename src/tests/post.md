# This is an example post

In this example we will do a couple of cool markdown things.

## This is a h2 header
*This text is written in italic!*
### Look at this!
**This text is BOLD!**

## Hello world!
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
}
```
This is super cool!

## Time to link some random website!
This [should be clickable](https://example.com)

## Image test
![this should show an image](./image.png)

## This is an ordered list
1. one
2. six
3. seven

## This is an unordered one
- six
- nine
- six
- nine
